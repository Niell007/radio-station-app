- üéµ Music Library Management
- üé§ Karaoke System
- üìù Show Scheduling
- üë• User Authentication
- üìä Admin Dashboard
- üé∂ Playlist Management

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: [Astro](https://astro.build)
- **UI**: [React](https://reactjs.org) + [Tailwind CSS](://tailwindcss.com) + [Flowbite](https://flowbite.com)
- **Database**: [Cloudflare D1](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1)
- **Storage**: [Cloudflare R2](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2)
- **AI Features**: [Cloudflare AI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai)
- **Authentication**: JWT + Argon2
- **Deployment**: [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com)

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20.11.1 or higher
- npm 10 or higher
- Cloudflare account with Pages, D1, and R2 enabled
- Git

## Local Development

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/radio-station-app.git
   cd radio-station-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Copy environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. Update environment variables in `.env` with your values

5. Initialize the database:
   ```bash
   npm run init-db
   ```

6. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Deployment

### Automatic Deployment (GitHub Actions)

1. Fork this repository
2. Add the following secrets to your GitHub repository:
   - `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`
   - `CLOUDFLRE_ACCOUNT_ID`

3. Push to the main branch to trigger deployment

### Manual Deployment

1. Build the project:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Deploy to Cloudflare Pages:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy:production
   ```

### Preview Deployments

For preview deployments:
```bash
npm run deploy:preview
```

## Environment Variables

Required environment variables:

- `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`: Your Cloudflare account ID
- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`: API token with Pages deployment permissions
- `DATABASE_URL`: D1 database connection string
- `R2_ACCOUNT_ID`: R2 storage account ID
- `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: R2 access key
- `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: R2 secret key
- `AI_API_TOKEN`: Cloudflare AI API token
- `SESSION_SECRET`: Random string for session encryption

See `.env.example` for all required variables.

## Database Migrations

Run database migrations:
```bash
npm run prisma:migrate
```

## Security Considerations

- **Authentication**: Implemented using JWT and Argon2 for secure password hashing.
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control to ensure users have appropriate permissions.
- **Data Encryption**: Sensitive data such as passwords and session tokens are encrypted.
- **Security Best Practices**: Regular security audits and updates to dependencies.
- **Environment-specific Configurations**: Separate configurations for development, staging, and production environments.

## Performance Requirements

- **Expected Load Capacity**: The application is designed to handle up to 10,000 concurrent users.
- **Response Time Targets**: Average response time should be under 200ms.
- **Scalability Considerations**: The application is built to scale horizontally with the use of Cloudflare's serverless infrastructure.
